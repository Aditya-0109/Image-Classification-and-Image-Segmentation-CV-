# Image-Classification-and-Image-Segmentation-CV-
This repository contains implementations of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification and segmentation tasks using PyTorch. The primary focus is on classifying images from a wildlife dataset and segmenting objects within images using various models and techniques.

Image Classification
Models Implemented:
1)CNN from scratch
2)Fine-tuned ResNet18

Dataset:
The wildlife dataset consists of various categories of animals and their habitats.

Techniques Used:
1)Data augmentation to improve dataset diversity
2)Transfer learning for fine-tuning a pretrained ResNet18 model

Image Segmentation
Models Evaluated:
1)Segmentation model (custom implementation)
2)Pre-trained DeepLabv3Plus-PyTorch model

Dataset:
The segmentation dataset includes images with corresponding color-coded masks indicating segmented objects.

Tasks:
1)Visualization of data distribution, images, and corresponding masks.
2)Model inference and evaluation.
3)Performance evaluation metrics: pixel-wise accuracy, IoU, mAP.
4)Analysis of model performance and cross-domain analysis.

Conclusion
This repository serves as a comprehensive toolkit for wildlife image classification and segmentation tasks, providing insights into model performance and potential areas for enhancement. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to further improve the models and techniques.
